            <h1>Buying from the shop</h1>
            <p>Are you planning to buy anything from the shop soon? Of course you are. This is why you came to this book after all. If so, continue reading, because this article will help you buy items in the shop like a pro.</p>
            <p>Firstly, you are probably a F2P player. As with any other game developer, Supercell loves to manipulate you and confuse you with a multitude of shop offers with different discounts. But, here’s the catch: Not all offers are worth your gems.</p>
            <h2>What NOT to buy</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Never buy brawlers.</strong> Leave it to boxes instead, even if the brawler is on offer! Trust me, you will eventually get that brawler in your boxes.</li>
                <li><strong>Never buy coins</strong>. Coins might be useful when you just need to upgrade that new brawler. However, using your hard-earned gems to buy coins is absolutely foolish. Leave it to your boxes instead.</li>
                <li><strong>Never EVER buy pin packs!</strong> (Unless you have nothing better to do.) Pin packs are only useful once you have maxed out all your brawlers and have all the skins. Since this is unlikely, I suggest that you skip these pin packs. Besides, you get pin packs for free in Brawl Pass, and Supercell has proven that you can get pin packs for free via its China Anniversary Week 2021.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>What to buy instead</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Buy token doublers if on offer.</strong> Token doublers can drastically speed up your Brawl Pass progress, which means you will be able to unlock rewards much faster. Verdict: Buy if possible</li>
                <li><strong>Buy experience packs.</strong> If you’re just starting out on the game, this might sound crazy, but, as you gain experience, you will find such packs really helpful. These packs offer great value, but, please note: they only come at experience milestones, such as 50XP, 100XP, and so on. Verdict: An occasional indulgence.</li>
                <li><strong>Buy boxes.</strong> Compared to other items, boxes are really a matter of luck. Boxes help you gain brawler upgrades, gadgets and star powers, and even new brawlers! Of course, sometimes you get nothing out of it; this is why I suggest you only buy it if your brawler drop rates are high or you need that star power. Verdict: A respectable choice, even if there are better deals around.</li>
            </ol>
